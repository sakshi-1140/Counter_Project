# Counter_Project(Html, Css, Js)
Project Overview :-
Make a simple counter page using DOM elements

Project Goals:- 

Create the UI as shown in the diagram.

Edit the DOM elements accordingly.

On click of the increment button, increment the innerhtml of the middle div by 1 and on click of decrement, decrement by 1

On clicking clear, set the inner html of middle div to 0 and set this button to display.none if count = 0

If count >1 then set the style for this button to block.
